What is LINQ?
	
	LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is uniform query syntax in C# to retrieve data from different sources and formats.

	For example, SQL is a Structured Query Language used to save and retrieve data from a database. 
	In the same way, LINQ is a structured query syntax built in C# to retrieve data from different types of data sources
	such as,
		collections, ADO.Net DataSet, XML Docs, web service and MS SQL Server and other databases.
	
	LINQ queries return results as objects.
